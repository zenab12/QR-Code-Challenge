## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox(Responsive)


### What I learned

I Learned How to center the content in page and started to use Variables in css to make clean code and optimized 

```html
<body>
  <main>
    <div class="card"></div>
  </main>
</body>
```

```css
body {margin :0;display:flex;flex-direction:column; min-height:100vh}
main{display:flex;place-items:center;place-content:center;flex-grow:1}
```

### Continued development
I will use flexbox and grid template in comming Challenges with Allah willing  in professional way.
